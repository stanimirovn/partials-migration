App Metrics v1.6.2 and earlier is incompatible with the following <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> patch versions:

* PAS v2.5.20 and later
* PAS v2.6.15 and later 
* PAS v2.7.9 and later
* PAS v2.8.3 and later

This incompatibility is caused by an update to nodejs-offline-buildpack v1.7.9, 
which removes support for Node.js 8.x.

If you upgrade to one of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> versions above and you are using App Metrics v1.6.2 or earlier, then App Metrics no longer works.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to App Metrics v1.6.3 or later.
