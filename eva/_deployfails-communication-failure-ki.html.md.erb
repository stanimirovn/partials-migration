* If you have VMware Tanzuâ„¢ SQL with MySQL for VMs (Tanzu SQL for VMs) v2.10 installed
and **TLS Options** is set to any value other than **Not Configured**
in the **Security** pane of the Tanzu SQL for VMs tile,
then the **Deploy <%= vars.product_full %>** errand fails with an error similar to the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    ERROR:

    The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.
