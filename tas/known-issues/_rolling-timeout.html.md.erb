Rolling app deployments do not properly timeout when the startup 
timeout is reached. You may experience a rolling app deployment process 
that hangs indefinitely.

If you experience a hanging rolling app deployment, you can 
manually terminate the process. For more information about terminating the rolling app deployment process, see the cf CLI v7 procedure in 
[Cancel a Deployment](../devguide/deploy-apps/rolling-deploy.html#cancel).
