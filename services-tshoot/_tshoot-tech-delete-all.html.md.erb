<p>
  This errand uses the Cloud Controller API to delete all instances of your brokerâ€™s
  service offering in every Cloud Foundry org and space. It only deletes instances
  the Cloud Controller knows about.
  It does not delete orphan BOSH deployments.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: Orphan BOSH deployments do not correspond to a known service instance.
  While rare, orphan deployments can occur. Use the <code>orphan-deployments</code>
  errand to identify them.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>delete-all-service-instances</code> errand does the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unbinds all apps from the service instances.</li>
  <li>
    Deletes all service instances sequentially. Each service instance deletion includes:
    <ol>
      <li>Running any pre-delete errands</li>
      <li>Deleting the BOSH deployment of the service instance</li>
      <li>Removing any ODB-managed secrets from BOSH CredHub</li>
      <li>Checking for instance deletion failure, which results in the errand failing immediately</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Determines whether any instances have been created while the errand was running.
    If new instances are detected, the errand returns an error.
    In this case, VMware recommends running the errand again.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Use extreme caution when running this errand.
  You should only use it when you want to totally destroy all of the on-demand service
  instances in an environment.
</p>

<p>
  To run the errand, run the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>bosh -d service-instance_GUID delete-deployment</code></pre>
