    symptom: 'If developers report errors such as:
		<pre class="terminal">Server error, status code: 504, error code: 10001, message: The request to the service broker timed out: https://BROKER-URL/v2/service_instances/e34046d3-2379-40d0-a318-d54fc7a5b13f/service_bindings/aa635a3b-ef6d-41c3-a23f-55752f3f651b</pre>',

    cause: 'Cloud Foundry might not be connected to the service broker, or there might be a large number of queued tasks.',

    solution: 'To troubleshoot:
		<ol>
		<li>
		Confirm that Cloud Foundry (CF) is <a href="#network">connected to the service broker</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
		Check the BOSH queue size:
		<ol>
		<li>Log in to BOSH as an admin.</li>
		<li>Run <pre><code>bosh tasks</code></pre></li>
		</ol>
    If there are a large number of queued tasks, the system may be under too much load.
		BOSH is configured with two workers and one status worker, which might not be
		sufficient resources for the level of load.
		</li>
		<li>
		If the task queue is long, advise app developers to try again once the system is under less load.
		</li>
