    <td>
      To solve this issue, ask the user to send application logs that show the connection error.
      If the error originates from the service, then follow <%= vars.product_short %>-specific instructions.
      If the issue appears to be network-related, then:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Check that <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/app-sec-groups.html">application security groups</a>
          are configured correctly.
          Access should be configured for the service network that the tile is deployed to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the network the <%=  vars.app_runtime_abbr  %> tile is deployed
          to has network access to the service network. You can find the network definition
          for this service network in the BOSH Director tile.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <%= vars.ops_manager %> go into the service tile and see the service
          network that is configured in the networks tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <%= vars.ops_manager %> go into the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr  %> tile and see the network it is assigned to.
          Make sure that these networks can access each other.
        </li>
      </ol>
