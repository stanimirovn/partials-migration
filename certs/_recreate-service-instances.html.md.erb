After activating a new root CA in Ops Manager, some BOSH VMs report an unresponsive agent. This error occurs if you do not recreate all service instances for a service tile when rotating the root CA.

You can recreate all service instances by enabling the **Recreate all service instance** errand in the service tile before applying changes.

For service tiles that do not have this errand, first apply changes in Ops Manager and then run the following BOSH command manually for each service instance deployment:

<pre>
bosh -d SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT recreate
</pre>

Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT` is the BOSH deployment name of the service instance.

For more information, see [Rotating CAs and Leaf Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/security/pcf-infrastructure/rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html).

The services tiles that do not have the **Recreate all service instance** errand include:

* VMware Tanzu GemFire
* MySQL for Pivotal Platform v2.7.5 and earlier
* MySQL for PCF v2.6.6 and earlier
* MySQL for PCF v2.5.10 and earlier
* RabbitMQ for PCF v1.15.4 and earlier
* Redis for PCF v2.0.22 and earlier
