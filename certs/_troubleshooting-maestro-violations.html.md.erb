The <%= vars.ops_manager %> API invokes CredHub Maestro when rotating certificates. If a
certificate rotation API command is unsafe, CredHub Maestro stops the command and returns one
or more safety violations.

For example, CredHub Maestro stops a certificate rotation API command if you try to perform
certificate rotation steps in the wrong order. Because performing these steps in the wrong
order can make your deployment unstable or cause downtime, CredHub Maestro stops the command
and returns an error message.

For information about how to troubleshoot safety violation errors that are returned when rotating
certificates, see [Troubleshooting CredHub Maestro Safety Violations During Certificate Rotation]
(troubleshoot-cert-errors.html).
