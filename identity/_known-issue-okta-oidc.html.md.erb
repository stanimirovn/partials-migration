* **Authorization for Okta OpenID Connect (OIDC):** When using an Okta OIDC provider, the roles claim in the ID token does not get populated with external identity provider (IdP) groups. This impacts the mapping of external IdP groups to scopes. Despite this limitation, you can still use Okta OIDC provider for authentication.
