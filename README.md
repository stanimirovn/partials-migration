# PCF Docs Partials Repo

This project contains cross product partials for PCF docs content repos.
This repo allows products with cross-product partials to pull from one versioned source.

Previously, some of these partials were sourced from the v018.x branch of the
[On Demand Service Broker SDK](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-on-demand-service-broker) content repo and
did not support versions.
