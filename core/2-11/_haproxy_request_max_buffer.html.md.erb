If you expect requests larger than the default maximum of 16.384&nbsp;KB, enter a new value in bytes for **HAProxy request maximum buffer size**. You may need to do this, for example, to support apps that embed a large cookie or query string values in headers. Requests larger than the maximum value result in a gateway error.
