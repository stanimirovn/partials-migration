TCP routing is disabled by default. You should enable this feature if your DNS sends TCP traffic through a load balancer rather than directly to a TCP router. To enable TCP routing:
   1. Under **TCP routing**, select **Enable**.
      <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you have mutual TLS app identity verification enabled, app containers accept incoming communication only from the Gorouter. This disables TCP routing.</p>
   1. For **TCP routing ports**, enter one or more ports to which the load balancer forwards requests. To support multiple TCP routes, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends allocating multiple ports. Do one of these steps:
      * To allocate a single port or range of ports, enter a single port or a range of ports.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you configured AWS for <%= vars.platform_name %> manually, enter <code>1024-1123</code> which corresponds to the rules you created for <code><%= vars.product_name_lc %>-tcp-elb</code>.</p>
      * To allocate a list of ports:
         1. Enter a single port in the **TCP routing ports** field.
         1. After deploying <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, follow the procedure in [Router Groups: Modify TCP port reservations](../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html#modify-ports).
   1. (Optional) For **TCP request timeout**, modify the default value of 300 seconds. This field determines when the TCP router closes idle connections from clients to apps that use TCP routes. You may want to increase this value to enable developers to push apps that require long-running idle connections with clients.
   1. Follow these additional instructions based on your IaaS:
