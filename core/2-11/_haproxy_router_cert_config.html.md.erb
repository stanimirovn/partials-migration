Under **Certificates and private keys for the Gorouter and HAProxy**, you must provide at least one certificate and private key name and certificate key pair for the Gorouter and HAProxy. The Gorouter and HAProxy are enabled to receive TLS communication by default. You can configure multiple certificates for the Gorouter and HAProxy.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When providing custom certificates, enter them in this order: <code>wildcard</code>, <code>Intermediate</code>, <code>CA</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/pem-ssl-creation.htm">Creating a .pem File for SSL Certificate Installations</a> in the DigiCert documentation.</p>
  1. Click **Add** to add a name for the certificate chain and its private key pair. This certificate is the default used by the Gorouter and HAProxy. You can either provide a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or click on the **Generate RSA Certificate** link to generate a certificate generated by the <%= vars.ops_manager %> CA. For the values to use, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/operating/security_config.html)).
  	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you configured <%= vars.ops_manager %> Front End without a certificate, you can use this new certificate to complete <%= vars.ops_manager %> configuration. To configure your <%= vars.ops_manager %> Front End certificate, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#config-frontend">Configure Front End</a> in <em>Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP Manually</em>.</p>
  1. If you want to configure multiple certificates for the Gorouter and HAProxy, click **Add** and fill in the appropriate fields for each additional certificate key pair. For details about generating certificates in <%= vars.ops_manager %> for your wildcard system domains, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/operating/security_config.html)).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that you add any certificates that you generate in this pane to your infrastructure load balancer.</p>
