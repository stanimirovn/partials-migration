In the **Minimum version of TLS supported by the Gorouter and HAProxy** field, select the minimum version of TLS to use in Gorouter and HAProxy communications. The Gorouter and HAProxy use TLS v1.2 by default. If you need to accommodate clients that use an older version of TLS, select a lower minimum version. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [TLS Cipher Suite Support](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers) in _Securing Traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.
