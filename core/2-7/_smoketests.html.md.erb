In the **Smoke Tests** pane, you configure the org and space where smoke tests are run. In the org and space you configure in the **Smoke Tests** pane, the Smoke Tests errand pushes an app to a <%= vars.platform_name %> org to run basic functionality tests against the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile after an installation or update. In the **Errands** pane, you can choose whether or not to run the Smoke Tests errand.

To configure the **Smoke Tests** pane:

1. Select **Smoke Tests**.

1. If you have a shared apps domain, select **A temporary space within the system org**, which creates a temporary space within the `system` org for running smoke tests and deletes the space afterwards. Otherwise, select **A specified org and space** and complete the fields to configure where <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> pushes an app to run smoke tests:
	* For **Org**, enter the org <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> should use when pushing an app to run smoke tests.
	* For **Space**, enter the space <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> should use when pushing an app to run smoke tests.
	* For **Domain**, enter the domain <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> should use when pushing an app to run smoke tests.

1. Click **Save**.
