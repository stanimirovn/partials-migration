In **File Storage**, you determine where you want to place the file storage for your Cloud Controller.

To configure the **File Storage** pane:

1. Select **File Storage**.

1. To set the maximum number of recent valid packages that your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum valid packages per app** field. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends leaving the default value of `2`. However, you can lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. To set the maximum number of recent valid droplets that your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum staged droplets per app** field. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends leaving the default value of `2`. However, you can lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. Under **Configure file storage backup level**, select what you want to back up from your blobstores:
	* **Complete file storage backup** includes the entire blobstore. This includes droplets, packages, and buildpacks.
	* **Exclude droplets from file storage backup** excludes droplets from your backup. If you choose this option, you must re-stage all apps during a restore.
	* **Exclude droplets and packages from file storage backup** excludes droplets and packages from your backup. If you choose this option, you must re-push all apps during a restore.

	For more information about the advantages and disadvantages of excluding droplets and packages, see [File Storage Backup Level](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/backup-restore/file-storage-backup-level.html).

1. For **Configure your Cloud Controller's filesystem**, see [Configuring File Storage for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](./pas-file-storage.html).
