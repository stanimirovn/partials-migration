Under **TLS termination point**, configure how <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> handles `x-forwarded-client-cert` (XFCC) HTTP headers based on where TLS is terminated for the first time in your deployment. The table below indicates which option to choose based on your deployment configuration:
<table class="nice">
<tr>
  <th>Deployment Configuration</th>
  <th>TLS Option</th>
  <th>Additional Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>The load balancer is terminating TLS, and</li>
      <li>The load balancer is configured to put the client certificate from a mutual authentication TLS handshake into the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert HTTP header</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>Infrastructure load balancer</td>
  <td>Both HAProxy and the Gorouter forward the XFCC header when included in the request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>The load balancer is configured to pass through the TLS handshake through TCP to the instances of HAProxy, and</li>
      <li>HAProxy instance count is more than <code>0</code></li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>HAProxy</td>
  <td>HAProxy sets the XFCC header with the client certificate received in the TLS handshake. The Gorouter forwards the header.
    <p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If you select the <strong>The Gorouter does not request client certificates</strong> option in the <strong>Gorouter behavior for client certificate validation</strong> field, the XFCC header cannot be delivered to apps.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>The load balancer is configured to pass through the TLS handshake through TCP to instances of the Gorouter</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>Gorouter</td>
  <td>The Gorouter strips the XFCC header if it is included in the request and forwards the client certificate received in the TLS handshake in a new XFCC header.<br/><br/>
  If you have deployed instances of HAProxy, app traffic bypasses those instances in this configuration. If you have also configured your load balancer to route requests for SSH directly to the Diego Brain, consider reducing HAProxy instances to <code>0</code>.
