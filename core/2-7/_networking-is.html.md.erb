In the **Networking** pane, you configure security and routing services for your IaaS.

To configure the **Networking** pane:

1. Select **Networking**.

1. (Optional) Under **Gorouter IPs**, enter one or more static IP addresses for the Gorouters that handle this isolation segment. These IP addresses must be within the subnet CIDR block that you defined in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> network configuration for your isolation segment. If you have a load balancer, configure it to point to these IP addresses.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Entering the static IP addresses is not necessary for deployments running on a public IaaS such as AWS, GCP, or Azure because users specify the IaaS load balancer in the <strong>Resource Config</strong> pane of the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile.</p>

1. If you want to use HAProxy for this isolation segment, enter at least one address in the **HAProxy IPs** field. You should specify more than one IP address for high availability. Then configure your load balancer to forward requests for the domains you have set up for your deployment to these IP addresses. For more information, see [Configuring SSL/TLS Termination at HAProxy](../opsguide/ssl-term-haproxy.html).
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you rely on HAProxy for a feature in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and you want isolated networking for this isolation segment, you may want to deploy the HAProxy provided by the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile.</p>


1. For **DNS search domains**, enter DNS search domains as a comma-separated list. Your containers append these search domains to hostnames to resolve them into full domain names.

1. The **Enable Silk policy enforcement** checkbox is selected by default. To disable Silk network policy enforcement between apps, deselect the checkbox. Disabling network policy enforcement allows all apps to send network traffic to all other apps in the foundation despite no policy specifically allowing it.

1. Select a sharding mode in the **Gorouter sharding mode** field. For more information, see [Sharding Gorouters for Isolation Segments](../adminguide/routing-is.html#sharding-routers-isolation-segment) in _Routing for Isolation Segments_.
	* **Isolation segment only**: The Gorouters for the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile acknowledge requests only from apps deployed within the Diego Cells of the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile. All other requests fail.
	* **No isolation segment**: The Gorouters for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile reject requests from any isolation segment. Choose this option to add a group of Gorouters for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, such as when you want a private point of entry for the system domain.

1. (Optional) For additional security, enter headers that you want the Gorouter to remove from app responses in **Remove specified HTTP response headers**.

1. Click **Save**.
