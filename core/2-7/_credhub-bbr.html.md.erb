In <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>, you can back up CredHub and its data with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR). For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

Ensure you also back up your encryption key. If you do not back up your encryption key, you cannot restore your BBR backups. For more information, see [Back Up the Encryption Keys](#encryption-keys).
