In the **Cloud Controller** pane, you configure the Cloud Controller.

To configure the **Cloud Controller** pane:

1. Select **Cloud Controller**.

1. Enter your **Cloud Controller database encryption key** if all of the following are true:
  * You deployed <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> previously.
  * You then stopped <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> or it crashed.
  * You are re-deploying <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> with a backup of your Cloud Controller database.
  <br><br>
  For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.platform_name %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/backup-restore/).

1. **Cloud Foundry API rate limiting** prevents API consumers from overwhelming the platform API servers. Limits are imposed on a per-user or per-client basis and reset on an hourly interval.
	<br><br>
	To disable Cloud Foundry API rate limiting, select **Disable** under **Cloud Foundry API rate limiting**. To enable Cloud Foundry API rate limiting:
	1. Under **Cloud Foundry API rate limiting**, select **Enable**.
	1. For **General limit**, enter the number of requests a user or client is allowed to make over an hour-long interval for all endpoints that do not have a custom limit. The default value is `2000`.
	1. For **Unauthenticated limit**, enter the number of requests an unauthenticated client is allowed to make over an hour-long interval. The default value is `100`.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database connection validation timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes. You can enter `-1` to cause Cloud Controller to make an additional query to the database whenever connections are checked out from the pool. Choosing `-1` has performance implications.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database read timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes.

1. (Optional) Enter in days the **Age of audit events pruned from Cloud Controller database**.

1. (Optional) Enter in days the **Age of completed tasks pruned from Cloud Controller database**.

1. (Optional) Rotate the Cloud Controller database (CCDB) encryption key using the **Encryption key ledger** field. For more information, see [Rotating the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Key](../opsguide/rotate-ccdb-key.html).

1. Click **Save**.
