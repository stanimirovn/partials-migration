(Optional) Increase the value of **Load balancer unhealthy threshold** to specify the amount of time, in seconds, that the Gorouter continues to accept connections before shutting down. During this period, health checks may report the Gorouter as unhealthy, which causes load balancers to failover to other Gorouters. Set this value to an amount greater than or equal to the maximum time it takes your load balancer to consider a Gorouter instance unhealthy, given repeated failed health checks.
