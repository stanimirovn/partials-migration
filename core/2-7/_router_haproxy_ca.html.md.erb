(Optional) When validating client requests using mutual TLS, the Gorouter trusts multiple certificate authorities (CAs) by default. To configure HAProxy to trust the same CAs as the Gorouter, enter your CA certificates under **Certificate Authorities trusted by the Gorouter and HAProxy**. All CA certificates should be appended together into a single collection of PEM-encoded entries.
