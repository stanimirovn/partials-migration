To use an external S3-compatible filestore for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> file storage:

1. Select **External S3-compatible filestore**.

1. For **URL endpoint**, enter the `https://` URL endpoint for your region. For example,
`https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`.

1. If you use an AWS instance profile to manage role information for your filestore, enable
the **S3 AWS with instance profile** checkbox. For more information, see [AWS Identity and
Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html)
in the AWS documentation.

<% if aws == true %>
1. (Optional) If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment is on AWS, you can alternatively
enter the **Access key** and **Secret key** of the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-user` you
created when configuring AWS for <%= vars.platform_name %>. If you enable the **S3 AWS with
instance profile** checkbox and also enter an **Access key** and **Secret key**, the instance
profile overrules the access key and secret key.
<% end %>

1. From the **S3 signature version** dropdown, select **V4 signature**. For more information
about S3 signatures, see [Signing AWS API Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the AWS documentation.

1. For **Region**, enter the region in which your S3 buckets are located. For example,
`us-west-2`.

1. To encrypt the contents of your S3 filestore, select **Server-side encryption**. This
option is only available for AWS S3.

1. (Optional) If you selected **Server-side encryption**, you can also specify a **KMS key
ID**. <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses the KMS key to encrypt files uploaded to the blobstore.
If you do not provide a KMS Key ID, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses the default AWS key. For
more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS–Managed Keys
(SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the AWS
documentation.

1. Disable the **Path-style S3 URLs (deprecated)** checkbox. When this checkbox is disabled,
the S3 bucket is accessed using the virtual-hosted model instead of the path-based model. The
deprecated path-based model is removed from AWS as of September 30, 2020. For more information
about S3 path deprecation, see [Amazon S3 Path Deprecation Plan – The Rest of the Story]
(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/)
on the AWS News Blog.

1. Enter names for your S3 buckets:
    <table border="1" class="nice">
      <tr>
        <th width="30%"><%= vars.ops_manager %> Field</th>
        <th width="30%">Value</th>
        <th width="40%">Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Buildpacks bucket name</strong></td>
        <td><code><%= vars.product_name_lc %>-buildpacks-bucket</code><br></td>
        <td>This S3 bucket stores app buildpacks.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Droplets bucket name</strong></td>
        <td><code><%= vars.product_name_lc %>-droplets-bucket</code></td>
        <td>This S3 bucket stores app droplets. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that
          you use a unique bucket name for droplets, but you can also use the same name
          as above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Packages bucket name</strong></td>
        <td><code><%= vars.product_name_lc %>-packages-bucket</code></td>
        <td>This S3 bucket stores app packages. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that
          you use a unique bucket name for packages, but you can also use the same name
          as above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Resources bucket name</strong></td>
        <td><code><%= vars.product_name_lc %>-resources-bucket</code></td>
        <td>This S3 bucket stores app resources. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that
          you use a unique bucket name for app resources, but you can also use the same
          name as above.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. Configure these checkboxes depending on whether your S3 buckets have versioning enabled:
    * For versioned S3 buckets, enable the **Use versioning for backup and restore** checkbox
    to archive each bucket to a version.<br>
    If you are using Dell ECS, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends against versioned buckets.
    For more information, see _Step 3: Configure PAS File Storage_ in [Dell EMC ECS with
    Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://www.dellemc.com/resources/en-us/asset/white-papers/products/storage/h17569_wp_ecs_with_pivotal_cloud_foundry_config_guide_and_best_practices.pdf). You can
    use mirroring as an alternative to versioning.
    * For unversioned S3 buckets, disable the **Use versioning for backup and restore**
    checkbox, and enter a backup bucket name for each active bucket. The backup bucket name
    must be different from the name of the active bucket it backs up. For more information
    about setting up external S3 blobstores, see [Enable Versioning on Your S3-Compatible
    Blobstore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#enable-s3-versioning)
    in _Backup and Restore for External Blobstores_ in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

1. Enter the name of the region in which your backup S3 buckets are located. For example,
`us-west-2`. These are the buckets used to back up and restore the contents of your S3
filestore.

1. (Optional) Enter names for your backup S3 buckets:
    <table border="1" class="nice">
      <tr>
        <th width="30%"><%= vars.ops_manager %> Field</th>
        <th width="30%">Value</th>
        <th width="40%">Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Backup buildpacks bucket name</strong></td>
        <td><code>buildpacks-backup-bucket</code><br></td>
        <td>This S3 bucket is used to back up and restore your buildpacks bucket. This bucket
          name must be different from the buckets you named above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Backup droplets bucket name</strong></td>
        <td><code>droplets-backup-bucket</code></td>
        <td>This S3 bucket is used to back up and restore your droplets bucket.
          <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use a unique bucket name for droplet
          backups, but you can also use the same name as above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Backup packages bucket name</strong></td>
        <td><code>packages-backup-bucket</code></td>
        <td>This S3 bucket is used to back up and restore your packages bucket.
          <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use a unique bucket name for package
          backups, but you can also use the same name as above.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. Click **Save**.
