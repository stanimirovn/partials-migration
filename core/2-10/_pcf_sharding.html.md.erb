You can configure Gorouter sharding for isolation segments depending on your use case:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th style="width:33%">Use Case</th>
		<th style="width:33%">Description</th>
		<th>How to Configure</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Securing apps that run in an isolation segment</td>
		<td>To provide security guarantees in addition to the firewall rules described above, you can configure sharding of the Gorouter's routing table, resulting in a Gorouter dedicated to an isolation segment that only recognizes routes for apps in the same isolation segment.</td>
		<td>
			<ol>
				<li>In the <strong>Networking</strong> pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, enable the <strong>Gorouters reject requests for isolation segments</strong> checkbox.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong>Gorouter sharding mode</strong> in the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile to <strong>Isolation segment only</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Deploying additional Gorouters for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %></td>
		<td>The flexibility of the configuration also supports deployment of a Gorouter that excludes all isolation segments.</td>
		<td>
			<ol>
				<li>In the <strong>Networking</strong> pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, enable the <strong>Gorouters reject requests for isolation segments</strong> checkbox.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong>Gorouter sharding mode</strong> in the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile to <strong>No isolation segment</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
  	</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For compute isolation only, you can leave the <strong>Gorouters reject requests for isolation segments</strong> checkbox disabled. This is the default setting, which does not require any additional Gorouters for the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile.</p>
