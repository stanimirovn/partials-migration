In the **App Developer Controls** pane, you configure restrictions and default settings for your apps.

To configure the **App Developer Controls** pane:

1. Select **App Developer Controls**.

1. Enter the **Maximum file upload size** in MB. This is the maximum size of an app and buildpack upload.

1. Enter the **Maximum package size** in MB. This is the maximum total size of an app's files.

1. Enter the **Default app memory** in MB. This is the default amount of memory allocated to a newly-pushed app if no value is specified with `cf push`.

1. Enter the **Default app memory quota per org** in MB. This is the default memory limit for all apps in an org. The specified limit only applies to the first installation of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. After the initial installation, operators can use the cf CLI to change the default value.

1. Enter the **Maximum disk quota per app** in MB. This is the maximum amount of disk allowed per app.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you allow developers to push large apps, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> may have trouble placing them on Diego Cells. Additionally, in the event of a system upgrade or an outage that causes a rolling deploy, larger apps may not successfully re-deploy if there is insufficient disk capacity. Monitor your deployment to ensure your Diego Cells have sufficient disk to run your apps.</p>

1. Enter the **Default disk quota per app** in MB. This is the amount of disk allocated by default to a newly-pushed app if no value is specified with `cf push`.

1. Enter the **Default service instance quota per org**. The specified limit only applies to the first installation of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. After the initial installation, operators can use the cf CLI to change the default value.

1. Enter the **Staging timeout** in seconds. When you stage an app droplet with the Cloud Controller, the server times out after the number of seconds you specify in this field.

1. For **Internal domains**, enter one or more domains that apps use for internal DNS service discovery. If you specify a domain using `cf push -d`, other <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> apps can reach the pushed app at `APP-NAME.INTERNAL-DOMAIN`. This value defaults to `apps.internal`.

1. Enable the **Allow space developers to manage network policies** checkbox to permit developers to manage their own network policies for their apps.

1. Click **Save**.
