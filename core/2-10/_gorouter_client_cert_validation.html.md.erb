To configure Gorouter behavior for handling client certificates, select one of the following options in the **Gorouter behavior for client certificate validation** field:
	* **The Gorouter does not request client certificates:** Client certificates are not requested, so the client does not provide them and validation of client certificates does not occur. This option is incompatible with the **TLS termination point** options **HAProxy** and **Gorouter** because these options require mutual authentication.
	* **The Gorouter requests but does not require client certificates:** The Gorouter requests client certificates in TLS handshakes and validates them when presented, but does not require them. This is the default configuration.
	* **The Gorouter requires client certificates:** The Gorouter validates that the client certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority that the Gorouter trusts. If the Gorouter cannot validate the client certificate, the TLS handshake fails.

	<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Requests to the platform fail upon upgrade if your load balancer is configured with client certificates and the Gorouter does not have the CA. To mitigate this issue, select <strong>The Gorouter does not request client certificates</strong>.</p>
