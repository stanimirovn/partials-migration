Errands are scripts that <%= vars.ops_manager %> runs automatically when it installs or uninstalls a product, such as a new version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. There are two types of errands: _post-deploy errands_ run after the product is installed, and _pre-delete errands_ run before the product in uninstalled.

By default, <%= vars.ops_manager %> always runs all errands.

In the **Errands** pane, you can change these run rules. For each errand, you can select **On** to run it always or **Off** to never run it.

For more information about how <%= vars.ops_manager %> manages errands, see [Managing Errands in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/managing_errands.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Several errands, such as App Autoscaler and Notifications, deploy apps that provide services for your deployment. When one of these apps is running, selecting <strong>Off</strong> for the corresponding errand on a subsequent installation does not stop the app.</p>

* **Smoke Test Errand** verifies that your deployment can:

    * Push, scale, and delete apps
    * Create and delete orgs and spaces
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If both the V2 and V1 Firehoses are disabled,
             then disable the Smoke Test Errand.
             Otherwise, the deploy fails.
    </p>

* **Usage Service Errand** deploys the Usage Service app, which Apps Manager depends on.

* **Apps Manager Errand** deploys Apps Manager, a dashboard for managing apps, services, orgs, users, and spaces. Until you deploy Apps Manager, you must perform these functions through the cf CLI. After Apps Manager has been deployed, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends setting this errand to **Off** for subsequent <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployments. For more information about Apps Manager, see [Getting Started with Apps Manager](../console/dev-console.html).

* **Notifications Errand** deploys an API for sending email notifications to your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> platform users.
    <p id='notifications' class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The Notifications app requires that you configure SMTP with a username and password, even if you set the value of <strong>SMTP Authentication Mechanism</strong> to <code>none</code>. To configure SMTP with a username and password, see <a href='#smtp'>Configure Email Notifications</a>.</p>

* **Notifications UI Errand** deploys a dashboard for users to manage notification subscriptions.

* **App Autoscaler Errand** pushes the App Autoscaler app, which enables you to configure your apps to automatically scale in response to changes in their usage load. For more information, see [Scaling an App Using App Autoscaler](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html).

* **App Autoscaler Smoke Test Errand** runs smoke tests against App Autoscaler.

* **NFS Broker Errand** pushes the NFS Broker app, which supports NFS Volume Services for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. For more information, see [Enable NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html#nfs-enable) in _Enabling Volume Services_.
    <p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> If you are using NFS Volume Services, you must run the **NFS Broker Errand** errand in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr_pivotal %> v2.8 before upgrading to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9. Running this errand migrates service instances for NFS Volume Services from MySQL to CredHub. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-9/upgrade/checklist.html#run-nfs-broker-errand">Run the NFS Broker Errand</a> in <em>Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.platform_name %> v2.9</em>.</p>

* **Metric Registrar Smoke Test Errand** verifies the Metric Registrar can access custom metrics emitted by an app and convert them into Loggregator metrics.
	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The Metric Registrar Smoke Test errand runs only if the Metric Registrar is enabled. For more information about configuring the Metric Registrar, see <a href ="../metric-registrar/index.html">Configuring the Metric Registrar</a>.</p>

* **SMB Broker Application Errand** pushes the SMB Broker app, which supports SMB Volume Services for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. For more information, see [Enable SMB Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html#smb-enable) in _Enabling Volume Services_.

* **Rotate CC Database Key** translates sensitive data in the Cloud Controller database to the currently specified **Primary** key. You specify this key in the **Encryption key ledger** field of the **Cloud Controller** pane.
