The table below provides the instance counts <%= vars.company_name %> recommends for a high-availability deployment and the minimum instances for a functional deployment:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Diego Cell</td>
    <td>&ge; 3</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The optimal balance between CPU and memory sizing and instance count depends on the performance characteristics of the apps that run on Diego Cells. Scaling vertically with larger Diego Cells makes for larger points of failure, and more apps go down when a Diego Cell fails. On the other hand, scaling horizontally decreases the speed at which the system re-balances apps. Re-balancing 100 Diego Cells takes longer and demands more processing overhead than re-balancing 20 Diego Cells.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Diego Brain</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>For high availability, use at least one per AZ, or at least two if only one AZ.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Diego BBS</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>For high availability in a multi-AZ deployment, use at least one instance per AZ. Scale Diego BBS to at least two instances for high availability in a single-AZ deployment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MySQL Server</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>If you use an external database in your deployment, then you can set the MySQL Server instance count to <code>0</code>. For instructions about scaling down an internal MySQL cluster, see <a href="../mysql/scaling-mysql.html#scale-down">Scaling Down Your MySQL Cluster</a>.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>MySQL Proxy</td>

  <tr>
    <td>NATS Server</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>In a high-availability deployment, you might run a single NATS instance if your deployment lacks the resources to deploy two stable NATS servers. Components using NATS are resilient to message failures and the BOSH Resurrector recovers the NATS VM quickly if it becomes non-responsive. NATS includes metrics as well as route registration and deregistration messages. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends scaling NATS VMs to 2 or more CPU.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cloud Controller</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Scale the Cloud Controller to accommodate the number of requests to the API and the number of apps in the system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Clock Global</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>For a high-availability deployment, scale the Clock Global job to a value greater than 1 or to the number of AZs you have.
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Router</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Scale the Gorouter to accommodate the number of incoming requests. Additional instances increase available bandwidth. In general, this load is much less than the load on Diego Cells.</td>

    <td>Loggregator Traffic Controller</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Deploying additional Loggregator Traffic Controllers allows you to direct traffic to them in a round-robin manner. For a high-availability deployment, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends at least two per AZ.</td>

    <td>Syslog Scheduler</td>
    <td>&ge; 2</td>
