<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> includes an optional, beta routing plane that uses a service mesh. A service mesh provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices. It enables new features such as weighted routing. For more information, see [Service Mesh (Beta)](../adminguide/service-mesh.html). 

To add service mesh to your deployment:

1. Under **Service mesh (beta)**, select **Enable**.

1. For **IP addresses for Istio router**, do the following depending on your IaaS:
	* **vSphere**: Enter static IPs for the Istio routers. You must configure your load balancer with these IPs as well.
	* **Other**: Leave this field blank.

1. For **External domain**, enter the domain name that points to the load balancer in front of your Istio router.

1. For **Istio router TLS keypairs**, complete the following fields. You can add more than one keypair if desired using the **Add** button.
	* **Name**: Enter a name for the keypair.
	* **Certificate and private key for Istio router**: Enter the private key and certificate for TLS handshakes with clients. These must be in PEM block format.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Create a load balancer and add it to the **Resource Config** pane as described in [Deploying Service Mesh (Beta)](../opsguide/deploying-service-mesh.html).
