1. If you are not using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM as your jumpbox, install the latest [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/) on your jumpbox.

1. From the Installation Dashboard in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, select **BOSH Director** > **Status** and record the IP address listed for the Director. You access the BOSH Director using this IP address.

1. From the command line, log in to the BOSH Director, using the IP address that you recorded above. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE log-in
    ```
    Where:
    * `DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address recorded above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate as outlined in [Set Up your Jumpbox](backup-pcf-bbr.html#setup-jumpbox).

1. When prompted for **Email ()**, specify `director`.

1. When prompted for **Password ()**, enter the **Director Credentials** that you obtained in [Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).

    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh -e 10.0.0.3 \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate log-in
    Email (): director
