* For **Denied logging interval**, set the per-second rate limit for packets blocked by either a container-specific networking policy or by App Security Group (ASG) rules applied across the space, org, or deployment. This field defaults to `1`. For more information, see [Policies](../concepts/understand-cf-networking.html#policies) in _Container-to-Container Networking_ and [Restricting App Access to Internal <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Components](../opsguide/app-sec-groups.html).
* For **UDP logging interval**, set the per-second rate limit for UDP packets sent and received. This field defaults to `100`.
* To enable logging for app traffic, enable the **Log traffic for all accepted and denied app packets** checkbox. This increases log volume. For more information, see [App Traffic Logging](../opsguide/logging-config-opsman.html#app-traffic-log) in _Configuring Logging in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.
