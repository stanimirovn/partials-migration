Setting appropriate ASGs is critical for a secure deployment. To acknowledge that once the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment completes, it is your responsibility to set the appropriate ASGs:
	1. Select **App Security Groups**.
	1. In the **Type "X" to acknowledge this requirement** field, enter `X`.
	1. Click **Save**.

For more information about ASGs, see [App Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html). For more information about setting ASGs, see [Restricting App Access to Internal <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Components](../opsguide/app-sec-groups.html).
