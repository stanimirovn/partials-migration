In the **TLS cipher suites for HAProxy** field, review the TLS cipher suites for TLS handshakes between HAProxy and front end clients such as load balancers and the Gorouter. The default value for this field is:<br>
`DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
<br/>
<br/>
To modify the default configuration, use an ordered, colon-separated list of TLS cipher suites in the OpenSSL format. Operators should verify that the ciphers are supported by any clients or front end components that initiate TLS handshakes with HAProxy.
<br/>
Verify that every client participating in TLS handshakes with HAProxy has at least one cipher suite in common with HAProxy.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Specify cipher suites that are supported by the versions configured in the <strong>Minimum version of TLS supported by the Gorouter and HAProxy</strong> field.</p>
