Under **Select the range of TLS versions supported by the Gorouter and HAProxy**, select the range of TLS versions to use in Gorouter and HAProxy communications. The Gorouter and HAProxy support TLS v1.2 to TLS v1.3 by default. If you need to accommodate clients that use an older version of TLS, select a lower minimum version. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [TLS Cipher Suite Support](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers) in _Securing Traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.
