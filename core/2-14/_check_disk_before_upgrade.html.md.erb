Confirm that the BOSH Director VM has adequate disk space for your upgrades.
You need at least 20&nbsp;GB of free disk space to upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
If you plan to upgrade other products, the amount of disk space required
depends on how many tiles you plan to deploy to your upgraded <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

To check current persistent disk usage:

1. Navigate to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select the **Status** tab.

1. Review the value of the `PERS. DISK` column. If persistent disk usage is higher than 50%:
	1. Select the **Settings** tab
	1. Select **Resource Config**.
	1. Increase your persistent disk space to handle the size of the resources.
           If you do not know how much disk space to allocate, set the value to at least 100&nbsp;GB.
