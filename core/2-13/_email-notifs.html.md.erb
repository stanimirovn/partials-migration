In the **Email Notifications** pane, you can enable end-user self-registration. <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses SMTP to send invitations and confirmations to Apps Manager users. If you do not need this service, leave this pane blank and disable the **Notifications** and **Notifications UI** errands in the **Errands** pane.

To configure the **Email Notifications** pane:

1. Select **Email Notifications**.

1. For **From email**, enter the email address from which email notifications are sent.

1. For **SMTP server address**, enter the SMTP address of the server that sends emails.

1. For **SMTP server port**, enter the port of the SMTP server that sends email notifications.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For GCP, you must use port 2525. Ports 25 and 587 are not allowed on GCP Compute Engine.</p>

1. For **SMTP server credentials**, enter the username and password for the SMTP server that sends email notifications.

1. Enable the **SMTP enable automatic STARTTLS** checkbox if you want your SMTP server to automatically create a secure TLS connection when sending emails.

1. Verify your authentication requirements with your email admin and use the **SMTP authentication mechanism** dropdown to select **None**, **Plain**, or **CRAMMD5**. If you have no SMTP authentication requirements, select **None**.

1. If you selected **CRAMMD5** as your authentication mechanism, enter a secret in the **SMTP CRAMMD5 secret** field.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not configure the SMTP settings using this form, the admin must create orgs and users using the cf CLI. For more information, see <a href="../adminguide/cli-user-management.html">Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI</a>.</p>
