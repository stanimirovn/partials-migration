In the **Networking** pane, you configure security and routing services for your IaaS.

To configure the **Networking** pane:

1. Select **Networking**.

1. (Optional) Under **Gorouter IPs**, enter one or more static IP addresses for the Gorouters that handle this isolation segment. These IP addresses must be within the subnet CIDR block that you defined in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> network configuration for your isolation segment. If you have a load balancer, configure it to point to these IP addresses.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Entering the static IP addresses is not necessary for deployments running on a public IaaS such as AWS, GCP, or Azure because users specify the IaaS load balancer in the <strong>Resource Config</strong> pane of the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile.</p>

1. If you want to use HAProxy for this isolation segment, enter at least one address in the **HAProxy IPs** field. You should specify more than one IP address for high availability. Then configure your load balancer to forward requests for the domains you have set up for your deployment to these IP addresses. For more information, see [Configuring SSL/TLS Termination at HAProxy](../opsguide/ssl-term-haproxy.html).
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you rely on HAProxy for a feature in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and you want isolated networking for this isolation segment, you may want to deploy the HAProxy provided by the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile.</p>

1. For **DNS search domains**, enter DNS search domains as a comma-separated list. Your containers append these search domains to hostnames to resolve them into full domain names.

1. The **Enable Silk policy enforcement** checkbox is selected by default. To disable Silk network policy enforcement between apps, deselect the checkbox. Disabling network policy enforcement allows all apps to send network traffic to all other apps in the foundation despite no policy specifically allowing it.

1. (Optional) In the **Sticky session cookies** field, enter one or more sticky session cookie names.
The default cookie name is `JSESSIONID`.
Some apps require a different cookie name.
For example, Spring WebFlux requires `SESSION` for the cookie name.
Gorouter uses these cookies to support session affinity, or _sticky sessions_.
For more information, see [Session Affinity](../concepts/http-routing.html#sessions) in _HTTP Routing_.

1. (Optional) For additional security, enter headers that you want the Gorouter to remove from app responses in **Remove specified HTTP response headers**.

1. Click **Save**.
