If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment uses HAProxy and you want it to receive traffic only from specific sources, configure these fields:
  * **HAProxy protected domains:** Enter a comma-separated list of domains to protect from unknown source requests.
	* (Optional) **HAProxy trusted CIDRs:** Enter a space-separated list of CIDRs to limit which IP addresses from the **HAProxy protected domains** can send traffic to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
