## <a name="pcfcredhub"></a> CredHub in <%= vars.platform_name %>

A <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment stores credentials in these locations:

* **BOSH CredHub**: Colocated with the BOSH Director on a single VM. This CredHub instance stores credentials for the BOSH Director.

* **Runtime CredHub**: Deployed as an independent service and stores service instance credentials.

### <a name="bosh"></a> BOSH CredHub

In <%= vars.platform_name %>, the BOSH Director VM includes a CredHub job. This provides a lightweight credential storage instance for the BOSH Director. The BOSH Director, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), and other tiles store credentials in BOSH CredHub. For more information, see in _Retrieving Credentials from Your Deployment_.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This configuration does not provide high availability.</p>

In this colocated deployment architecture, the BOSH Director, CredHub, UAA, and the BOSH Director database are all installed on a single BOSH VM, as shown in the diagram below:

### <a name="runtime"></a> Runtime CredHub

The <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile deploys CredHub as an independent service on its own VM. This provides a highly available credential storage instance for securing service instance credentials. For more information, see [Securing Service Instance Credentials with Runtime CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-12/operating/secure-si-creds.html).

CredHub is a stateless app, so you can scale it to multiple instances that share a common database cluster and encryption provider.

With CredHub as a service, the load balancer and external databases communicate directly with the CredHub VMs, as shown in the diagram below:

## <a id='store-creds'></a> Using CredHub to Store Credentials for Service Tiles

If you develop a service tile for <%= vars.platform_name %> and want to store its credentials in BOSH CredHub, see [CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/credhub.html) in _<%= vars.platform_name %> Tile Developer Guide_.
