In the **TLS cipher suites for the Gorouter** field, review the TLS cipher suites for TLS handshakes between the Gorouter and front end clients such as load balancers or HAProxy. The default value for this field is `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.
<br/>
<br/>
To modify the default configuration, use an ordered, colon-separated list of Golang-supported TLS cipher suites in the OpenSSL format. This field does not apply to TLS v1.3. For TLS v1.3, the Gorouter only uses a set of default ciphers, and this is not configurable.
<br/>
<br/>
Operators should verify that the ciphers are supported by any clients or front end components that initiate TLS handshakes with the Gorouter. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [TLS Cipher Suite Support](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers) in _Securing Traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.
<br/>
<br/>
Verify that every client participating in TLS handshakes with the Gorouter has at least one cipher suite in common with the Gorouter.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Specify cipher suites that are supported by the versions configured under <strong>Select the range of TLS versions supported by the Gorouter and HAProxy</strong>. For example, TLS v1.3 does not support configuring cipher suites. If you select <strong>TLSv1.3 only</strong>, you cannot configure cipher suites for the Gorouter or HAProxy.</p>
