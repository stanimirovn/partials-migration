In the **App Autoscaler** pane, you configure the App Autoscaler service. To use App Autoscaler, you must create an instance of the service and bind it to an app. To create an instance of App Autoscaler and bind it to an app, see [Set Up App Autoscaler](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html#setup) in _Scaling an App Using App Autoscaler_.

To configure the **App Autoscaler** pane:

1. Select **App Autoscaler**.

1. For **Autoscaler instance count**, enter the number of instances of the App Autoscaler service you want to deploy. The default value is `3`. For high availability, set this number to `3` or higher. Larger environments might require more instances than the default number. We recommend one App Autoscaler instance for every 10 apps using App Autoscaler.

1. For **Autoscaler API instance count**, enter the number of instances of the App Autoscaler API you want to deploy. The default value is `1`. Larger environments may require more instances than the default number.

1. For **Metric collection interval**, enter how many seconds of data collection you want App Autoscaler to evaluate when making scaling decisions. The minimum interval is 60 seconds, and the maximum interval is 3600 seconds. The default value is `120`. Increase this number if the metrics you use in your scaling rules are emitted less frequently than the existing metric collection interval.

1. For **Scaling interval**, enter in seconds how frequently App Autoscaler evaluates an app for scaling. The minimum interval is 15 seconds, and the maximum interval is 120 seconds. The default value is `35`.

1. To enable verbose logging for App Autoscaler, select the **Enable verbose logging** checkbox. Verbose logging is disabled by default. Enable this checkbox to see more detailed logs. Verbose logs show specific reasons why App Autoscaler scaled the app, including information about minimum and maximum instance limits, App Autoscaler's status. For more information about App Autoscaler logs, see [App Autoscaler Events and Notifications](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html#notifs) in _Scaling an App Using App Autoscaler_.

1. If you do not want the Autoscaler API to reuse HTTP connections, select the **Disable API connection pooling** checkbox. This may be necessary if your front end idle timeout for the Gorouter is set to a low value, such as 1 second. For more information, see [Configuring Front End Idle Timeout for Gorouter and HAProxy](frontend-idle-timeout.html).

1. To enable email notifications of Autoscaler events, select the **Enable email notifications** checkbox. For more information about managing email notifications, see [App Autoscaler Events and Notifications](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html#notifs) in _Scaling an App Using App Autoscaler_.

1. Click **Save**.
