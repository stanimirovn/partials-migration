(Optional) If app developers in your organization want certain HTTP headers on HTTP Requests to appear in their app logs with information from the Gorouter, specify them in the **HTTP headers to log** field with a comma-separated list. For example, to support app developers that deploy Spring apps to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you can enter Spring-specific HTTP headers.
