<p>
When you deploy <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), you must create a statically defined network to host
the component VMs that make up the  infrastructure.
Components, such as Cloud Controller and UAA, run on this infrastructure network.
</p>

<p>
On-demand services might require you to host them on a separate network
from the  default network.
You can also deploy on-demand services on a separate service networks to meet your own security requirements.
</p>

<p>
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> supports dynamic networking.
Operators can use dynamic networking with asynchronous service provisioning to define
dynamically-provisioned service networks.
  For more information, see <a href="#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a> below.
</p>

<p>
On-demand services are enabled by default on all networks.
Operators can optionally create separate networks to host services in BOSH Director.
Operators can select which network hosts on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for
that service.
