The BOSH layer that underlies <%= vars.ops_manager %> generates `healthmonitor` metrics for all VMs in the deployment.
However, these metrics are not included in the Loggregator Firehose by default.
To send BOSH HM metrics through the Firehose, install the open-source [HM Forwarder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-hm-forwarder).
