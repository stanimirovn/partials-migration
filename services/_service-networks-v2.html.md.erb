When you deploy <%= vars.platform_old %>, you must create a statically defined network to host the component virtual
machines that constitute the <%= vars.product_old %> infrastructure.

<%= vars.platform_old %> components, like the Cloud Controller and UAA, run on this infrastructure network.
On-demand <%= vars.platform_old %> services may require that you host them on a network that runs separately from this
network. You can also deploy tiles on separate service networks to meet your own security
requirement.

###<%= vars.platform_old %> v2.0 and Earlier###

In <%= vars.platform_old %> v2.0 and earlier, cloud operators pre-provision service instances from <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For
each service, <%= vars.ops_manager %> allocates and recovers static IP addresses from a pre-defined block of
addresses.

To enable on-demand services in <%= vars.platform_old %> v2.0 and earlier, operators must create a service networks in
BOSH Director and select the **Service Network** checkbox. Operators then can select the
service network to host on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for that service.

###<%= vars.platform_old %> v2.1 and Later###

<%= vars.platform_old %> v2.1 and later include dynamic networking.
In <%= vars.platform_old %>v2.1 and later, operators can use dynamic
networking with asynchronous service provisioning to define dynamically-provisioned service
networks. For more information, see [Default Network and Service Network](#on-demand).

In <%= vars.platform_old %> v2.1 and later, on-demand services are enabled by default on all networks. Operators can
create separate networks to host services in BOSH Director, but doing so is optional.
Operators select which network hosts on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for
that service.
