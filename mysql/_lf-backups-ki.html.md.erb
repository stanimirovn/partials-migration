* **Leader-follower backups are overwritten:**
For leader-follower automated backups, <%= vars.product_short %> might store only one backup file
  from a random node.
  This issue occurs because leader and follower backup files are timestamped
  and stored in the same location.
  This can cause the files to overwrite each other. For information about backup files,
  see [Backup Files and Metadata](./backup.html#understanding-metadata).
