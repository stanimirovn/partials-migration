<%= vars.product_full %> uses a proxy to send client connections
to the healthy MySQL database cluster nodes in a highly available cluster plan.
Using a proxy gracefully handles failure of nodes, enabling fast,
failover to other nodes within the cluster. When a
node becomes unhealthy, the proxy closes all connections to the unhealthy node
and re-routes all subsequent connections to a healthy node.

The proxy used in <%= vars.product_short %> is Switchboard.
Switchboard was developed to replace HAProxy as the proxy tier for the high
availability cluster for MySQL databases in <%= vars.product_short %>.

At the top, there is a banner with the message 'all nodes are healthy'.
Below this is a table with the headings nodes, status, current sessions, and IP address.
For each node in the table, the status column is marked healthy." %>

Switchboard offers the following features:

- **MySQL Server Access**

    MySQL clients communicate with nodes through this network port.
    These connections are automatically passed through to the nodes.

- **Switchboard and API**

    Operators can connect to Switchboard to view the state of the nodes.
