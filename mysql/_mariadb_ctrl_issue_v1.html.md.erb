- **Known Issue:** More than one `mariadb_ctrl` process can run at the same time.  
This can lead to:  
      - One `mariadb_ctrl` process stopping another `mariadb_ctrl` process
      - `mariadb_ctrl` processes waiting indefinitely for MySQl to start 
      - Other issues when starting `mariadb_ctrl` processes
