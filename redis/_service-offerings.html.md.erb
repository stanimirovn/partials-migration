<%= redis_name %> packages Redis for easy deployment and operability.

There are two service offerings:

* **On-Demand Service**---Provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance.
  The operator can configure up to three plans with different configurations,
  memory sizes, and quotas
  App developers can provision an instance for any of the On-Demand plans offered
  and configure certain Redis settings.

* **Shared-VM Service**---Provides support for a number of Redis instances running
  in a single VM.
  It is designed for testing and development purposes only, **do not use the
  Shared-VM service in production environments**.
  The Shared-VM instances are pre-provisioned by the operator with a fixed number
  of instances and memory size.
  App developers can then use one of these pre-provisioned instances.

For more information on the plans, see:
