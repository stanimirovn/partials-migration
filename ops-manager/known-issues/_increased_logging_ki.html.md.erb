If your Loggregrator does not have sufficient memory to handle the increased system metrics emitted in <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.8 and later, you may experience dropped logs and slow consumers. This can impact logging and metrics platform functions.

To solve this issue, do the following:

* If you have <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, scale Loggregrator to handle the increased volume. See [Scaling Up <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/scaling-ert-components.html#scaleup). 

* In <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.9 or later, you can disable these system metrics if you don't need them. To do this, disable **Enable additional System Metrics** in the **Director Config** pane of the **BOSH Director** tile. For a list of metrics collected, see [System Metrics Agent](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/system-metrics-release/blob/develop/docs/system-metrics-agent.md) in GitHub.

For more information on this feature, see [All Platform VMs Emit System Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-8/release-notes.html#opsman-metrics).
