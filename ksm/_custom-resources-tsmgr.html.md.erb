+ If your chart uses custom resources, <%= vars.product_short %> might incorrectly report that a service instance
was created successfully before the custom resources are created.
This is because Kubernetes does not have a generic method to detect resource readiness.
Kubernetes primitives have known patterns for detecting readiness, but custom resource readiness is defined by its author. <br><br>
In the unlikely event that this happens, wait until the custom resources are created before binding
a service instances to an app.
This mitigates any issues with missing details in the bind response.
