* **The default setting for mirrored queues can cause the pre-stop script to timeout:**
In production, if you use mirrored queues with
the default policy setting `ha-sync-mode: manual` and if you have not manually synced
your queues, the pre-stop script can fail with
the following error: `"Timed out waiting for mirror queue critical node to sync after
3600 seconds"`. To manually sync your queues, run `rabbitmqctl sync_queue`.
To set `ha-sync-mode` to `automatic` instead, see
[Setting or Changing the Policy](./policies-pp.html#viewing).
